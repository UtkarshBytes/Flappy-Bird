# Flappy Bird Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Pygame. The game features an interactive gameplay experience where the player controls a bird to navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make the bird flap.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Navigate the bird through pipes by flapping.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for successfully passing through pipes.
- **Graphics**: Simple and engaging graphics, inspired by the original Flappy Bird game.
- **Sound Effects**: Includes sound effects for flapping and collisions (if applicable).

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- **Pygame**: The game uses Pygame for rendering and event handling. Install it via pip.

##Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:  pip install pygame

##Usage
Run the Game by using file Entry Point 
-----All you have to do is download then
--------Open Python Compiler and run the code of file (Entry-point.py)

##Gameplay
Objective: Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to achieve the highest score possible.
Game Over: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
